# Saola Vision Document

*Captured from Joe Eastwood Q&A — 2026-02-16*

---

## 🎯 The One-Liner

**Design-led Vietnamese lifestyle brand** — lighting, furniture, cafe culture, membership community.

---

## 📍 Strategic Sequence

```
1. Website (Shopify) → Fast, proves concept
2. Investment → Strategic partners (Mocal, Interwood)
3. Cafes → Self-funding marketing machines
4. Franchise → Scale across Vietnam + SEA
```

**Target: End of 2026 for website + first cafe**

---

## 💡 Core Concept

### The Cafe Model
Cafes are **paid-for marketing** that fund themselves:
- Coffee covers operating costs
- Furniture & lighting sales = profit
- Every item has QR code → drives online sales
- Showroom builds trust for website purchases

### Asset-Light Operations
- **No factory** — source from trusted suppliers
- **No heavy inventory** — ship from warehouse/factory direct
- **Vight relationship** — Saola pays design licensing fee to Vight

---

## 🪟 Window Display Network

**Concept:** Rent empty shop windows across HCMC as micro-storefronts

**How it works:**
1. Beautiful curated displays in empty windows
2. QR codes on window → product landing pages
3. Special "window exclusive" offers
4. Track performance by location
5. Rotate displays periodically

**Benefits:**
- Low cost vs full retail lease (~$50-200/mo)
- 24/7 passive marketing
- Test multiple locations cheaply
- Data on what works
- Build brand presence city-wide

**Data collected:**
- Scans per window
- Conversion rate by location
- Best-performing products
- Time-of-day patterns

### Why It Works:
- **Upfront cash** — membership fee covers mug cost + profit

- Can buy for delivery (display stays)
- Tracks which items get most interest

### In Windows:
- Location-specific landing pages
- UTM tracking for analytics
- Special window-only offers

### Tech Stack:
- Shopify handles all e-commerce
- Unique UTM parameters per location/product
- Meta pixel + Google ads for retargeting
- Email capture even without purchase

## 🏷️ Brand Positioning

### Identity:

- **"Made in Vietnam" story** travels well internationally

### Price Position:
- **Entry to mid-market** (A-B level)
- Accessible design upgrade (better than IKEA)

### Collections (TBD for launch):

- Experimental Rebel — Avant-garde
- Cosmopolitan Expert — Sustainable, refined
- Pretty & Posh — Classic elegant

*May launch 2 collections first, expand later*

---

## 🏪 Location Strategy

### Phase 1: First Cafe
- **Thao Dien or District 1** — flexible
- **Interwood property** — long shot but win-win if pitch looks good
- Need to scout options

### Phase 2: Expansion
- Open to D2, D7, Binh Thanh
- Each cafe has unique theme/product selection
- Consistent brand feel, different curation

### Cafe Design:
- Curated selection (not everything)
- Must look amazing
- "Running feel" across all locations
- **Yearly refresh** — new ranges keep it exciting
