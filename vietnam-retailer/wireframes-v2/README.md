# Saola Wireframes V2 — Product-First, Minimal

**Inspired by:** RH.com, Zara Home, Article, Castlery

## V1 vs V2 Comparison

| Aspect | V1 | V2 |
|--------|----|----|
| Homepage | Story section, cafe teaser, membership pitch, UGC, newsletter, tab bar | Hero product + 6 product grid. Done. |
| Text | Lots of explanation, brand story on every page | 2-3 sentences max. Products speak. |
| Cafes | Dedicated page, menu, membership tie-in | One "Visit" page with address. Period. |
| Membership | Full page with benefits, mug renders | Not shown (can add later if needed) |
| Navigation | 5-tab bar at bottom | Simple header + footer links |
| Whitespace | Moderate | Generous — let it breathe |
| CTAs | Multiple competing CTAs | One orange CTA where needed |
