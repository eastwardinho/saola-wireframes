- Diffused blend

### Complex Expression

- Layer gradients with reduced opacity

### Rules
- Max 2 colors per composition

## 4. TYPOGRAPHY

### Font: Basel Classic
- Designed by Chi-Long Trieu (Vietnamese designer)
- Well-engineered Vietnamese diacritics
- Contemporary with foundational versatility

### Weights
- **Basel Classic Book** — Body text, subheadings

### Tracking (Letter Spacing)
| Element | Tracking |
|---------|----------|
| Headings | Negative (-50) |
| Body text | Positive (+10) |
| Small caps | Positive (+100) |

### Leading (Line Spacing)
- Larger text = tighter leading (e.g., 140pt/140pt)
- Reduce default leading for visual balance

### Hierarchy
1. **Entry point:** Small caps, Book 24pt, tracking +100
2. **Heading:** Light 160pt, leading 150, tracking -50
3. **Subheading:** Book 36pt, auto leading
4. **Body:** Book 24pt, tracking +10

### Don'ts
- Don't use more than 3 font sizes

## 5. PRODUCT PHOTOGRAPHY

### Photography Types

| Type | Purpose | Expression |
|------|---------|------------|
| Product Profile | Catalogue | Clean white background, high-res closeups |

| Conceptual Context | Campaigns, surreal | Imaginative, atmospheric |
| Home & Home-like | Real life settings | Warm, comfortable, relatable |

### Golden Rules
1. **Product is always the star** — don't let background steal spotlight
2. **Light the product** — lamps should be ON, glowing
3. **Warm tones preferred** — avoid cool/isolated feeling
4. **Natural lighting** — replicate natural light
5. **Hyper-realistic rendering** — if CGI, make it real
6. **5% margin** — breathing space around product
7. **No power cords** in profile shots

### Don'ts
- Dark lighting
- Cool tones (isolation, coldness)
- Busy/chaotic backgrounds
- Unnatural poses
- Product lost in details
- Flat, lifeless rendering
