## Frank's Impressions

### What's Strong 💪

1. **Brand work is exceptional** — The identity, positioning, and visual system are professional and distinctive. "Find your Saola spirit" is memorable.

2. **Product range is ready** — 65 designs with technical files means you can go to suppliers tomorrow. The 4 collections give clear positioning from playful to premium.

3. **The gap is real** — Vietnamese home décor market is genuinely underserved. Competitors (Nhà Xinh, TÔT, JYSK) are either outdated, corporate, or lack soul.

4. **Unit economics work** — 65-75% margins on lighting, 50%+ on furniture. Cafe provides foot traffic + cash flow while retail builds.

5. **Target customer is clear** — "Thuy" is well-defined: 25-45, female, design-conscious, money to spend, wants guidance.

### What Needs Work 🔧

1. **Supplier network** — Original model was Vight factory. New model needs vetted suppliers for each material type (ceramic, bamboo, wood, terrazzo, metal). This is the critical path item.

2. **E-commerce before cafe?** — Original plan was e-commerce first. Cafes are capital-intensive. Consider: launch website with 10-15 hero products while scouting locations.

3. **Location economics** — D1 rent is brutal. Thao Dien makes sense for target demo. Run the numbers on smaller format in D1 vs. flagship in TD.

4. **Franchise model premature** — The 2030+ projections assume franchise scaling. Focus on proving 1-2 company-owned cafes first.

5. **Team** — Who runs day-to-day? Sammy's role? Need ops person for cafe + retail.

### Opportunities 🎯

1. **Nghiên Nhà trend** — "Home Décor Addiction" is real on Vietnamese social media. Content marketing opportunity is huge.

2. **Designer collabs** — The product range can expand through Vietnamese artist/designer partnerships without inventory risk.

3. **Corporate/hospitality** — Vight B2B connections could drive bulk orders for hotels, restaurants, offices.

4. **Pop-up before permanent** — Test demand with weekend pop-ups at existing venues before committing to lease.

### Questions to Answer

1. Which 10-15 products for launch? (Best margin + most "Instagrammable")
2. Supplier shortlist for ceramic, bamboo, wood?
3. Thao Dien location options + rent benchmarks?
4. Website platform choice? (Shopify VN, Haravan, custom?)
5. Timeline: realistic launch date?

---

## Next Steps (Suggested)

1. **Immediate:** Select launch product range (10-15 SKUs)
2. **Week 1:** Supplier outreach for hero products
3. **Week 2:** Location scouting Thao Dien
4. **Week 3-4:** Website/e-commerce setup
5. **Month 2:** Pop-up test event
6. **Month 3-6:** First cafe buildout
